Requirements:
	libpcap - http://www.tcpdump.org/release/
	mysql or oracle

For a successful compilation, in addition to the libraries, the application 
needs also the include files or the so-called devel packages in most of the 
distributions. Here is an example of what is needed for Debian:
  
  # apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient10 libmysqlclient10-dev libpcap0 libpcap-dev

For the rest of the Linux distributions the names of the packages are analogous.
Regarding the BSD systems - you only need to install the respective pkgsrc 
packages. If you are a beginner, it is recommended to install the necessary 
things from packages of the corresponding distribution/OS (deb,rpm,tgz/pkgsrc).
A frequent problem is the availability of 2 versions (for example) of mysql, 
one installed from a package, and the other - compiled and installed manually.

Installation:

Download the required version of netacct and unzip it:

  $ zcat netacct-mysql-0.7x.tar.gz|tar -xvf -
  $ cd netacct-mysql-0.7x

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su -
  # make install (as root)

By default netacct will be installed on /usr/local directory and the config 
files will be on /usr/local/etc/ , and the application itself will be on
/usr/local/sbin . If you want to install it somewhere else, use ./configure 
--prefix= and --sysconfdir= options.

If configure cannot find the installation of mysql (let's assume that you have 
installed mysql on /usr/local/mysql), use option --with-mysql=, specifying the 
way to the main directory of the installation of mysql. By analogy for libpcap 
use options --with-libpcap-libraries= and --with-libpcap-includes=

Preparation of mysql:

 Creation of the database, tables and user for mysql:
 NOTE: Edit netacct.sql and change the default password for user acct.
 Then execute the following:

 $ mysql -u root -p < netacct.sql

 If you are upgrading from previous version use upgrade.sql instead of
 netacct.sql. There is new table called 'rrd'.

 Do not forget to change the password in the naccttab config file of netacct.
  
 init.d initializing scripts:

 Can be found on contrib/ directory and are named with the corresponding 
 extension of the distribution which they are designed for:
  Debian, RedHati/Fedore Core, FreeBSD, Solaris

 Installation example of some of the scripts:
   RedHat:
    cp contrib/nacctd.redhat /etc/rc.d/init.d/nacctd
    chkconfig --add nacctd
   Debian:
    apt-get install rcconf
    cp contrib/nacctd.debian /etc/init.d/nacctd
    rcconf

 The rest of the distributions/OS are not supported currently because you have 
 not sent them to me to include them ;)
