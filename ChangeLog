	This maintains an internal clock (in variable now)

	Removed unneccessary globals flush and fname now that cfg is global

	* main.c: Cleaned up signal handling:
	 New handler alarm_handler for SIGALRM
	 Added comments

	Save old dumpfiles on startup (save_dumpfile)

	 Added fdelay to struct config. Added default define for fdelay.
	 Added dumpname to struct config.
	 Added field when to struct ipdata (to record last use of entry).

	Cleaned up alarm handler. Changed prototype of write_log accordingly.
	Added prototype for new alarm_handler.

	Adapted read_config to deal with new linked list of promisc devices.

	Provided sensible defaults for all of the values. These are imported from
	netacct.h.

	* netacct.h: Cleaned up promiscious device handling.
	Got rid of struct capture. This is now in struct promisc_device.
	There is now a linked list of devices to put into promiscous mode. This
	can be empty.

	Provided sensible defaults for some of the naccttab settings (DEFAULT_* defines)

	Removed define for version. This is now done with RCS.

	Configuration information is now a global.

	* daemon.c:

Wed Feb  8 15:18:05 1995  Ulrich Callmeier  <uc@brian>
